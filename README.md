## Hi there 👋 I am Swapnil Shah

Here are some highlights of my recent projects. Feel free to use them for learning. Do not expect everyting readily working out of the box as I have uploladed jupyter notebooks but not all .py. I was also not able to upload large (model/data) files used in GenAI projects.

**GenAI, Agentic AI**
- [Multi-Agent Healthcare Pro](https://github.com/sswapnil14/AgenticAI/blob/main/24_Build%20Multi-Agent%20Chatbot%20with%20AG2%20AutoGen%20for%20Healthcare.ipynb)
- [Meal Grocery Planner](https://github.com/sswapnil14/AgenticAI/blob/main/24_Build%20Multi-Agent%20Chatbot%20with%20AG2%20AutoGen%20for%20Healthcare.ipynb)
- [Image Captioning and Classification with VLMs](https://github.com/sswapnil14/GenAI/blob/main/11%20vlms.py)
- [LoRA fine-tuning](https://github.com/sswapnil14/GenAI/blob/main/3%20LoRA.py)
- [Transcribe and Generate Audio with Whisper and TTS](https://github.com/sswapnil14/GenAI/blob/main/10%20Transcribe%20and%20Generate%20Audio%20with%20Whisper%20and%20TTS.py)

**Deep Learning**
- [Autonomous Driving](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Autonomous_Driving/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection.ipynb)
- [Lunar Lander (Reinforced Learning)](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Machine_Learning/blob/main/10%20Reinforced%20Learning%20-%20Lunar%20Lander/Lunar_Lander.ipynb)
- [Transformer Netowrk](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Transformer/Transformer_Subclass_v1.ipynb)
- [Trigger Word Detection](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Deep_Learning/blob/main/Trigger_Word_Detection/Trigger_word_detection_v2a.ipynb)

**Machine Learning**
- [Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Machine_Learning/blob/main/3%20Neural%20Networks%20for%20Handwritten%20Digit%20Recognition/Neural%20Networks%20for%20Handwritten%20Digit%20Recognition.ipynb)
- [Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Machine_Learning/blob/main/7%20Anomaly%20Detection/Anomaly_Detection.ipynb)
- [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/sswapnil14/Machine_Learning/blob/main/9%20Recommender%20System/Movie%20Recommender%20System.ipynb)
