## Hi there 👋 I am Swapnil Shah
## Keep learning, keep innovating!

Here are some highlights of my recent projects. Feel free to use them for learning. Do not expect everyting readily working out of the box as I have uploladed jupyter notebooks but not all .py. I was also not able to upload large (model/data) files used in GenAI projects.
